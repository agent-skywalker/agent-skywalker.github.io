It shows there's a web server running on port 80

Navigating to Port 80 is this Webpage

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare2.png)

Studying the url it looks it is vulnerable to remote file inclusion vulnerability because the `page` parameter is being used to include a file dynamically (where a web application includes a file based on user input, without properly validating or sanitizing that input.), which can be controlled by an attacker. In this case, the `page` parameter is set to `home`, which suggests that the script is intended to include a file named `home.php` or `home.inc` or something similar.

So to test it out we setup a python http server and try to get a file that doesn't exist on my server

It show's it's vulnerable to remote file inclusion vulnerability


## Exploitation

To exploit this we are going to use `metasploit`  `php_include` module, more info on how to use this module found here [here](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/php-meterpreter/) .

We load the module in metasploit.


![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare4.png)

we can see a great number of options available to us.

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare5.png)

The most critical option to set in this particular module is the exact path to the vulnerable inclusion point. Where we would normally provide the URL to our PHP shell, we simply need to place the text **XXpathXX** and Metasploit will know to attack this particular point on the site.

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare6.png)

We run the exploit and gain a meterpreter shell

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare7.png)

We found FLAG1.txt

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare8.png)

We stabilize the shell

## Privilege Escalation

Looking around in the system we find that the /etc/shadow(File where all password hashes are stored) file is readable and writable. To confirm this i check the file permissions.

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare10.png)

I cat out the contents of `/etc/shadow` so i can see what hash is being used to hash the passwords

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare11.png)

I identified the hash as `sha-512`

On my attacker machine i create a password which i will substitute for the root password.

```
mkpasswd -m sha-512 pass
```

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare12.png)


I copied the contents of `/etc/shadow` file to a new file on my computer named `shadow` then i substituted the generated sha-512 password into root password

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare13.png)


I started a python http server on my attacker machine so i can download the modified `shadow` file to the target machine.

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare14.png)

Then i downloaded the modified shadow file into `/etc/shadow`

![snare badge](/assets/pwntilldwan/snare/snare15.png)

Then we switch user to root user and we got root shell
