The nmap scan shows an smb server is running, using smb null session we were able to list the available shares

![smbclient ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active2.png)

Trying to access the shares using anonymous login was not successful

![smbclient ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active3.png)


Looking at the shares there was another share which looked interesting `Replication` and we were able to connect to it using anonymous login

## Exploitation 

![smbclient ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active4.png)


Looking through the Policies folder i found an encrypted password for a user `active.htb\SVC_TGS` in a group policy xml file


![smbclient ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active5.png)

Using the tool `gpp-decrypt` the tester was able to decrypt the password 

![smbclient ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active6.png)

Using the credentials the tester was able to gain a shell in the `Users` share

![smbclient ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active7.png)

Navigating to the found users Desktop directory the tester was able to get the user flag

![smbclient ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active8.png)

Using the credentials with bloodhound-python the tester was able to obtain some domain data

![bloodhound-python ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active9.png)

Using bloodhound GUI the tester found 2 kerberoastable accounts

## Privilege Escalation

Using impackets getuserspns the tester was able to perform a kerberoast attack on user `administrator` and get the users kerberos hash

![kerberoast ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active11.png)

Using hashcat the tester was able to crack the kerberos hash and get the user cleartext password

![hashcat ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active12.png)

Using the new credentials the tester was able to get a shell on the machine using psexec

![psexec ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active13.png)

Navigating to the Desktop folder of the administrator user the tester found the `root.txt` file

![root ](/assets/hackthebox/active/active14.png)
